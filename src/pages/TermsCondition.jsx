        <h3>PRICING INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
          We try our best to show accurate prices, but sometimes mistakes
          happen. We can only confirm the price of an item after you order it.
          If there's a mistake in the price or information, we can reject or
          cancel your order unless it's already shipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we mess up the price, we might ask you what to do or cancel your
          order and let you know. Until we ship your item, your order isn't
          confirmed. We can change the price and ask you what to do next, or
          just cancel it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we accept your order, we'll charge your credit or debit card and
          let you know (by email or phone). We might charge you before we ship
          the item. But if we cancel the order after charging you, we'll put the
          money back on your card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices and what's available can change without warning, but we always
          try to give you the best value. Our discounts and special offers only
          apply to certain categories, not the whole website. Coupons might not
          work for things like diapers, baby food, or other stuff we decide on.
        </p>
        <h3>ACCURACY OF CONTENT</h3>
        <p>
          We try our best to show accurate information on our website, including
          prices and product descriptions. Prices already include GST (if
          applicable). The pictures and sizes of the products might not be
          exactly what you receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also can't guarantee the colors you see on your screen will be
          exactly the same as the real product. This is because screens can show
          colors differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Placing an order is like making an offer to buy something. We can then
          decide to accept or reject your offer, either entirely or in part. We
          only consider your order accepted once we actually ship the
          product(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have to ship your order in multiple parts, the part we send
          first is considered accepted. We can still decide to accept or reject
          the remaining items later. We won't consider your order accepted until
          we actually ship something.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you give us your email or phone number, we'll use that to confirm
          your order and let you know when we ship it (which means we've
          accepted your offer).**
        </p>
        <p>Here's what's changed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Formal language replaced with simpler words: "taken all care and
            precaution" becomes "try our best," "constitute an invitation to
            offer" becomes "like making an offer to buy something," etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sentence structure simplified: Complex sentences are broken down
            into shorter ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical terms explained: "GST" is explained as "Goods and Service
            tax."
          </li>
        </ul>
